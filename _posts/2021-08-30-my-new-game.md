### My New Game "Cute Fox" is Downloadable Now!

I've been working on a game project called "Cute Fox" for several days and I finally uploaded it on a platform called itch.io which game developers use to upload games they made.
I made some more games too but I don't think they are good enough to upload to itch.io

### It's Free to Play!

I know that I'm not a professional game developer :) Cute Fox is just 44 megabites and it's free to download. I couldn't upload some screenshots of the game because of MB limit on itch.io
I don't know how to take screenshots with lower sizes :( You can download the game using [this link](https://barkinsarikartal.itch.io/cute-fox).

### Which Game Engine Did I Use?

I used Unity Game Engine. It's free for personal projects and easy to use.
