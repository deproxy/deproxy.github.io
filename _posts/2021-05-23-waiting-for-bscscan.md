I sent new informations about YEX Token to BscScan, which is one of the Binance Smart Chain's most used websites. In BscScan, you can track all of BSC network's transactions and tokens. You can find many infos there. And if our token gets the new update (which contains the logo, project's aim and many more infos) you will be able to reach more information about our token.

Thank you for reading! And there is the BscScan link of our token: https://bscscan.com/token/0x03d8da4a711e9244793b88207c95b9926a61cea8

You can see YEX holders and transactions there.
