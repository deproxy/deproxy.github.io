My name is Barkın Sarıkartal. I was born on June 30, 2003 at Ankara/Turkey.

My father is a ship captain and my mother is a housewife.

My family lived in Çanakkale/Turkey for 3 years after my born because of my father's job.

After 3 years, they decided to move to Ankara/Turkey.

I went to Refika Aksoy School's kindergarten and primary school.

It was next to my house so I had much nice memories with my friends.

After graduating from the primary school, I studied at Private Arı School for 1 year.

I had a bad experience there cause I didn't know the private school life and I had many bad memories.

So I stopped being a student there and started studying at Private Seviye School.

I know it's a private school too but it could be tolerated. I had a better life of the education for 3 years there.

Anyway, I graduated there with good marks at 8th grade.

I enrolled in Private ASO Technical High School. I had much fun days there.

Technical lessons were fun but school's academic education was not enough for Turkey's university exam.

So I stopped studying there after 2 years and started looking for a school that had a better academic education.

I spent my last 2 years of high school in Private Yankı Anatolian High School.

When the day of university exam came, I did my best and my placement was 22,138 out of 2,416,748 valid exam. That equals to %0,91.

That was enough for some good universities in Turkey just like Çankaya University.

I was eligible to study at Çankaya University.

And now I'm studying Computer Engineering at Çankaya University.
