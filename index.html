My name is Barkın Sarıkartal. I was born on June 30, 2003 at Ankara/Turkey.

My father is a ship captain, my mother is a housewife and my sister is a student at Bilkent University.

I went to Refika Aksoy School's kindergarten and primary school.

After graduating from the primary school, I studied at Private Arı School.

I stopped being a student there after 1 year and started studying at Private Seviye School.

I graduated there with good marks at 8th grade.

After that, I enrolled in Private ASO Technical High School. 

Technical lessons were fun there but school's academic education was not enough for Turkey's university exam.

So I stopped studying there after 2 years and started looking for a school that had a better academic education.

I spent my last 2 years of high school in Private Yankı Anatolian High School.

When the day of university exam came, I did my best and my placement was 22,138 out of 2,416,748 valid exam. That is equal to %0,91.

I was eligible to study at Çankaya University with that score.

And now I'm studying Computer Engineering at Çankaya University.

And this is my best playlist which I listen to when I play Need For Speed: Most Wanted or when I feel happy:
